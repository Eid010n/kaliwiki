# gr-scan

Notes
-------
gr-scan is a program written in C++, and built upon GNU Radio, rtl-sdr, and the OsmoSDR Source Block. 
It is intended to scan a range of frequencies and print a list of discovered signals.
It should work with any device that works with that block, including Realtek RTL2832U devices.
